used numpy and open cv in the map class(written by Arjun Gandhi)

numpy:
  reshape: to turn 1d array map into 2d matrix
  ones: creates an array of all ones
  uint8: converts array to uint8 format

cv2:
  dilate: makes wall thicker
  erosion: not used in this lab but placed in function for unthickification of walls later
